This blog post demonstrates some concepts from probability theory and random variables.

### Introduction
Probability theory is a fundamental component of machine learning, as it covers the study of uncertainty and randomness. It entails the work of making predictions in the absence of complete information. Probability theory is an essential part of the mathematics behind machine learning. In this blog post we will walk through some concepts of probability theory.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r)
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2])
ax.grid(True)
plt.show()
